    Climate Change Fosters International Cooperation: Evidence from Water Treaties.

      </p>  
      <p><em> Climatic conditions, such as higher temperatures and lower precipitation, lead to a higher likelihood of signing Water Treaties in the short run, and even more so in the long run. By analyzing the impact of changes in climatic conditions observed between 1961-1975 and 1993-2007, we found that a one-degree Celsius increase in temperature has resulted in a 16.6% increase in the likelihood of signing WTs.</em></p>

    <p><em>  International trade is a partial solution to climate change by reallocating agricultural production on a global scale. This article constructs an indicator of water's capacity to produce agricultural goods, and shows how climate change may alter countries' Ricardian comparative advantages in 2050.</em></p>

    Pollution Haven and Corruption Paradise. <i>Journal of Environmental Economics and Management</i>, 85, 171-192, 2017. [<a href="https://www.freit.org/WorkingPapers/Papers/ForeignInvestment/FREIT925.pdf">Working Paper</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeem.2017.05.005">DOI</a>]
    <p>Co-authored with Elisa Dienesch. </p>
    <p><em>Trade integration promotes pollution havens: a 1% increase in access to the European market from a pollution haven fosters relocation there by 0.1%. We also find that corruption lowers environmental standards, which strongly attract polluting firms: a 1% increase of corruption fuels relocation by 0.28%.</em></p>

 <h2> Economic Geography (Selected Pub)</h2>
 <p>I am specialized in Economic Geography, a field which examines the spatial distribution of economic activities. I initially developed theoretical models at the intersection of international trade and urban economics to study the local impact of globalization, adapting welfare criteria to better evaluate the consequences of various spatial configurations. More recently, my research has turned empirical, focusing exclusively on either urban economics or international trade.

   <p><em> The spatial sorting of heterogeneous talented individuals, by impacting spatially on the opportunity cost to invest in skill acquisition, influences the regional creation of human capital. First a regional divergence in education investment occurs and then a convergence. The empirical analysis confirms that regional trade integration has been a determinant of the spatial distribution of skills in the USA.</em></p>
